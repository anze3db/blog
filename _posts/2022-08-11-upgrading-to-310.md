At my day job we have a Django app with almost `500_000` lines of Python code that was written over the last decade. Ever since we migrated to Python 3.7 (almost seven months *after* Python 2 EOL ðŸ˜“), we've tried to keep on top on Python upgrades. We migrated to 3.9 at the end of last year, skipping 3.8 completely. It was now time for us to jump on Python 3.10.

# Installing Python 3.10

We get the latest and greatest versions of Python through the excellent [deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa). Python 3.10 installs without a problem on the system, but `pip` is broken with Python 3.10 and Ubuntu 18.04:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py", line 187, in _run_module_as_main
    mod_name, mod_spec, code = _get_module_details(mod_name, _Error)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py", line 146, in _get_module_details
    return _get_module_details(pkg_main_name, error)

```

Luckily a quick Google search found [this GitHub thread with a solution](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2988#issuecomment-1008164915):

```
curl -Ss https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10
```

# Installing all dependencies

We use 290 of Python packages and they all installed successfully with Python 3.10 on first try ðŸŽ‰

# Get runserver to start

Now that we have Python and all the dependencies installed we can finally see if we can run our Django application. Unfortunately, running `python manage.py runserver` immediately failed with the following error:

```

Looks like we were using an out of date version of `eventlet` and upgrading that fixed the issue. Once it was upgraded the error went away, but only to give way to the next one:

`agate` package seems to be to blame this time. Upgrade and ðŸŽ‰ we have runserver up and running!

# Fixing the warnings on startup

Runserver now starts and we can already start interacting whith the app, but we have a huge amount of warnings on startup:

```

<frozen importlib._bootstrap>:914: ImportWarning: ImportHookFinder.find_spec() not found; falling back to find_module()
```

There were screens and screens full of these warnings, but there only two different types of messages:

```
<frozen importlib._bootstrap>:914: ImportWarning: ImportHookFinder.find_spec() not found; falling back to find_module()
```

This one was easy to solve, a quick Google search revelead that this is a warning caused by the newrelic package. Upgrading to the latest version solved it ðŸŽ‰

```
<frozen importlib._bootstrap>:914: ImportWarning: _SixMetaPathImporter.find_spec() not found; falling back to find_module()
```

This one seems to be caused by an out of date `six` package. What makes matters worse is that certain packages (I'm looking at you `botocore` ðŸ‘€) vendor their own `six` version so finding all the packages to update can be a bit annoying. I wrote a separate [blog post](https://blog.pecar.me/six-warnings) that shows how to find them all.

Now the Django dev server starts without errors:

```
[vagrant@bfdf66b9faee /vagrant]$ python manage.py runserver

```

# Getting all the tests to pass

Since clicking around the app was now working, it was time to run all the 6k+ tests that we have. First run and the results don't seem that bad:

```
47 tests failed out of 6185
```

I remember the upgrade from 2.7 to 3.7 where we had over 4k failing tests ðŸ˜…

It's even better than it seems because 45 of these tests came from the `us states` package:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/client/client/libs/integrations/tests/rbi/test_importer.py", line 4970, in test_delete_an_ingredient_location_default_unit_of_measure

  File "/root/client/client/libs/integrations/tests/rbi/test_importer.py", line 242, in test_import_locations
    location_success, location_error = _import_test_location(

    "state": get_us_state_abbreviation(
  File "/root/client/client/libs/integrations/rbi/utils/common.py", line 217, in get_us_state_abbreviation
    state_ = us.states.lookup(state)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/us/states.py", line 86, in lookup
    val = jellyfish.metaphone(val)
TypeError: str argument expected
```

The package has a pull request open with a fix, but unfortunately the maintainer is not responsive so a new version wasn't released yet. Really frustrating when this happens, but since we didn't really need the package that much we just decided to remove it. Less dependencies is always better!

The other two test failures were:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/client/client/libs/tests/tests_dataclass_utils.py", line 96, in test_bad_attribute_in_nested_data
    self.assertEqual(
AssertionError: "Coul[25 chars]ist: ParentList.__init__() got an unexpected k[17 chars]foo'" != "Coul[25 chars]ist: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'foo'"
- Could not instantiate ParentList: ParentList.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'foo'
?                                   -----------
+ Could not instantiate ParentList: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'foo'
```

and 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/client/client/libs/integrations/tests/rbi/datastructures/tests_attributes.py", line 85, in test_wrong_keys_raises_type_error
    self.assertEqual(str(exc.exception), expected_message)

?                                        ----------------
+ Could not instantiate NameTranslation: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'wrong_key'
```

We were asserting the exception message string and the message has changed slightly in Python 3.10. I've decided to just fix the asserts.

# Fin

That was it! There were a few gotchas, but not something that caused a huge amount of work and all the goodies in the new Python version are definitively worth it (woohooo `match` statement!). Now hopefully we don't break anything when pushing this to prod. ðŸ¤ž

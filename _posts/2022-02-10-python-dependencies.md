Python has multiple ways for delaing with dependecies and the options can seem intimidating. This blogpost explains the most common dependency management tools and some of the most common commands that one would run.

## requirements.txt

If you worked in Python you probably stumbled onto a file named `requirements.txt`. It's a file containing a list of items to be installed using pip install. An example file could have the following content:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
django
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And you can install it with

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
pip install -r requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The result of the command would look somewhat like:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting django
  Downloading Django-4.0.2-py3-none-any.whl (8.0 MB)
     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 8.0/8.0 MB 1.7 MB/s eta 0:00:00

Collecting asgiref<4,>=3.4.1
  Using cached asgiref-3.5.0-py3-none-any.whl (22 kB)
Installing collected packages: sqlparse, asgiref, django
Successfully installed asgiref-3.5.0 django-4.0.2 sqlparse-0.4.2
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And we can see that our requirements.txt file installed 3 packages. `asgiref-3.5.0 django-4.0.2 sqlparse-0.4.2`.

The issue with this is that you might install a newer version of Django, sqlparse, or asgiref anytime you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This might break your application code and is considered a bad practice.

To solve this problem you can lock all of the pacakges with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` that will save all the versions:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
django==4.0.2
asgiref==3.5.2
sqlparse==0.4.2
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

But now we have a different problem. We no longer know which dependencies are direct dependencies for our application (django) and which came from our dependencies' dependencies. This makes upgrading dependencies tricky.

Only use this approach for small side projects.

## pip-tools

pip-tools is a suite of tools that automate pinning and installing dependencies. You give it a list of dependencies that your project depends on (in our case that would be `django`) and it generates a requirements.txt file for us automatically. This way we can clearly separate the dependencies that we need from the dependencies or dependencies need, thus solving the main problem from the previous section.

We can create a file called `requirements.in` (although `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` are also supported) with the following content:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
django
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And then we can run `pip-compile requirements.in` which will generate the following requirements.txt file:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with python 3.10
# To update, run:
#
#    pip-compile requirements.in
#
asgiref==3.5.0
    # via django
django==4.0.2
    # via -r requirements.in
sqlparse==0.4.2
    # via django
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now that we have the generatd requirement.txt filem, we can install all the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or with `pip-sync requirements.txt`. The advantage of using pip-sync is that it will also uninstall all the packages not in requirements.txt making sure your environment matches the specification.

### Upgrading dependencies

Upgrading dependencies is done with `pip-compile --upgrade`. The command will respect the version pins in your `requirements.in` file. This means that if your `requirements.in` file contains `django<4.1` it will never upgrade django to Django 4.1.

### Dev dependencies

pip-tools doesn't have a way a built in way to separate your production dependencies with your development dependencies like some of the other tools do. Instead, we define a new requirements file and name it something like requirements-dev.in:

{% highlight python %}
-c requirements.txt
black
{% endhighlight %}

We can generate a compiled requirements-dev.txt file that will include our dev dependencies.

## Pipenv

Pipenv is not just a dependency management tool like pip-tools, but also a Python virtual enviornment manager. To start using pipenv we need to tell it which python version the project will be using: `pipenv --python 3.10`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
pipenv --python 3.10
Creating a virtualenv for this project...
Pipfile: /Users/anze/coding/python-package-managers/Pipfile
Using /usr/local/bin/python3 (3.10.2) to create virtualenv...
⠼ Creating virtual environment...created virtual environment CPython3.10.2.final.0-64 in 240ms
  creator CPython3Posix(dest=/Users/anze/.local/share/virtualenvs/python-package-managers-KVHa45pe, clear=False, no_vcs_ignore=False, global=False)
  seeder FromAppData(download=False, pip=bundle, setuptools=bundle, wheel=bundle, via=copy, app_data_dir=/Users/anze/Library/Application Support/virtualenv)

✔ Successfully created virtual environment!
Virtualenv location: /Users/anze/.local/share/virtualenvs/python-package-managers-KVHa45pe
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This command will do two things:
1. Generate a new development virtual environment using Python 3.10
2. Create a Pipfile with the following content:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now if we wanted to add django we would run `pipenv install django`

after running this our pipfile will look like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
django = "*"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And we will also have a Pipenv.lock file with the following content:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
{
    "_meta": {
        "hash": {
            "sha256": "7e6dca07b964c2888324e576ba6c1bc240d74a27b75619fc88bca2ee3979baf8"
        },
        "pipfile-spec": 6,
        "requires": {
            "python_version": "3.10"
        },
        "sources": [
            {
                "name": "pypi",
                "url": "https://pypi.org/simple",
                "verify_ssl": true
            }
        ]
    },
    "default": {
        "asgiref": {
            "hashes": [
                "sha256:2f8abc20f7248433085eda803936d98992f1343ddb022065779f37c5da0181d0",
                "sha256:88d59c13d634dcffe0510be048210188edd79aeccb6a6c9028cdad6f31d730a9"
            ],
            "markers": "python_version >= '3.7'",
            "version": "==3.5.0"
        },
        "django": {
            "hashes": [
                "sha256:110fb58fb12eca59e072ad59fc42d771cd642dd7a2f2416582aa9da7a8ef954a",
                "sha256:996495c58bff749232426c88726d8cd38d24c94d7c1d80835aafffa9bc52985a"
            ],
            "index": "pypi",
            "version": "==4.0.2"
        },
        "sqlparse": {
            "hashes": [
                "sha256:0c00730c74263a94e5a9919ade150dfc3b19c574389985446148402998287dae",
                "sha256:48719e356bb8b42991bdbb1e8b83223757b93789c00910a616a071910ca4a64d"
            ],
            "markers": "python_version >= '3.5'",
            "version": "==0.4.2"
        }
    },
    "develop": {}
}
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

We can see that like pip-tools from the section above, Pipfile.lock also includes the same version pins.

### Upgrading dependencies

To upgrade the dependencies we can run `pipenv update` and it will update all the versions in Pipfile.lock, respecting the constraint in the Pipfile.

### Dev dependencies

To add development dependencies we have to run `pipenv install --dev black` and this will place black into the development section of Pipenv.

## Poetry

We can start a new Poetry project with 

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
poetry init
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This will generate a new folder structrue for you that looks somewhat like this

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{% highlight python %}
poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

### Upgrading dependencies

To upgrade the dependencies we can run `poetry update` and it will update all the versions in poetry.lock, respecting the constraint in the `pyproject.toml`.

### Dev dependencies

To add development dependencies we have to run `poetry add --dev black` and this will place black into the development section of `pyproject.toml`.

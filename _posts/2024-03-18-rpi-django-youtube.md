🎥 [I made a video of me deploying a new Django project to my Raspberry Pi.](https://youtu.be/idL-Pmng36A) 🎥

It is not my first YouTube video because I uploaded a few ([1](https://youtu.be/p9E3j80CUvc), [2](https://youtu.be/GKX6zTiqiq0)) timelapse videos of me coding games a few years ago, but this is the first video that I scripted, edited, and created a thumbnail for. 🎉

# Why did I make this video?

Part of it was prep work for my talk at Pycon Italia (I'll be talking about [hosting side projects on a Raspberry Pi](https://2024.pycon.it/en/event/self-hosting-your-side-projects-with-django-and-duct-tape)), partially because I wanted to prove to myself that I *can* do it, and partially because it seems to me like all the cool kids are doing it (👋 [Tomaž](https://www.youtube.com/@tomazzaman), 👋 [Hynek](https://www.youtube.com/@The_Hynek), to name two).

# Who is the video for?

The first 50 videos you make are for yourself, and this is **doubly** true for me. This particular video isn't very useful. Honestly, I don't know what it is supposed to be. It's not an educational video since I speed through everything too fast, but it's also not a vlog or timelapse video like my older ones. So yes, it's a video for myself.

# What did I learn?

A lot of different things! I've been reading about video editing for the last few weeks, and while this doesn't make me a good editor, I can now explain what a J-cut and an L-cut are (among other things).

This also made me appreciate editing in film. How much thought and work goes into making a scene work well through editing is mind-blowing. My favorite example of this is Dune. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_z-BwZeuQs) for a great breakdown.

With my video, I shot myself in the foot by doing the picture-in-picture thing. This doubled the amount of editing that I had to do, and for someone who barely grasps video editing, this was not a good idea.

I had a lot of fun, and I hope I find the motivation to publish video #2 at some point 🤞

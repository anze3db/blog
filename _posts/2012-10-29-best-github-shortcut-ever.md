Today I watched [this awesome talk](http://confreaks.com/videos/1229-aloharuby2012-git-and-github-secrets) and it blew my mind. I never knew how many *secret* features github actually has. The talk is rather long, so let me just highlight the best shortcuts mentioned.

My favorite one by far is the `t` shortcut. Go to a github repo, press `t` and start typing a file name. It will list all the files that match your query. You can even use the arrow keys to select a file. Is this awesome or what?

You can also put `.diff` or `.patch` to any url that contains a diff and it will generate a plain text diff, or you can add `?w=1` to ignore whitespaces changes. `l` allows you to jump to a specific line while `w` helps you switch between a branch or a tag.

These are many other shortcuts and you can list them all by pressing `?`.

title: "I'm glad I became fit before becoming self-employed"
---


It's Friday night and I've just survived my first week of being self-employed. It's been a helluva ride getting all
the paperwork straightened out, finding an accountant, opening a new bank account, sending out invoices, and, the most frightening of all, actually talking to *people*. 
I much prefer talking to computers - programming, solving problems or even dealing with merge conflicts, but I'm an adult now 
and I'm told I can't just play around and code all day anymore.

It also means my life got a lot more stressful, but thankfully I've been preparing myself for this. Ever since the beginning 
of the summer I've been exercising more than ever before. Doing regular exercises (swimming, cycling, two  30 day challenges)
makes sure my body stays healthy. And my mind *needs* a healthy body to function correctly. I definetly can't solve that
programming problem if I can't even get out of bed in the morning.

Cycling really helps me deal with all the stuff going on in my life. When I'm out riding my bike, I have all the time in the world to think
about *everything* and *nothing*. Any physical activity is a great way to clear your head. 
I've solved many a difficult problem just by going out with my bike for an hour or so.

I've actually felt like I was going to get sick in the middle of the first week. My throat was starting to get sore and I tired sooner than
normal. I'm not sure whether this was due to a cold or the extra stress levels, but thankfully nothing happened. I just got better
and now I feel great again. I can't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure this wouldn't be the case if I wasn't in a good physical condition.

So the best advice I can give to people starting out with a new business: Get in shape, you're going to need every bit of energy you can muster.

title: Autogenerating og:images with Jekyll
date: 2025-06-10 02:38 +0100
---

This blog has been a static site powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for [over 13 years](https://blog.pecar.me/why-i-chose-jekyll), and I've been happy with the setup. After all this time, I still enjoy using my code editor to write new posts and `git commit` and `git push` to publish them.

However, there was one issue that often discouraged me from writing: I had to switch out of the code editor to generate the Open Graph image that appears on social media when I share the link to the blog post. For this particular blog post, this image looks like this:

![og image for this post](assets/images/og/posts/autogenerating-og-image-with-jekyll.png)

## jekyll-og-image

Today, I finally set aside some time to figure out how to automate this process. Luckily, there exists a Jekyll plugin that solves this problem: [jekyll-og-image](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov/jekyll-og-image).

Before I could use jekyll-og-image, I had to first configure [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag). At first, I was annoyed by this, but in the end, I was delighted with the result. After adding a few settings into `_config.yml`, the plugin allowed me to remove over 20 lines of tags from my layout:

Once jekyll-seo-tag was configured, I had to install one more dependency: [libvips](https://www.libvips.org/). jekyll-og-image uses this image processing library to generate the images. I installed it with Brew but I also needed to add it to my GitHub Actions runner as documented by the [jekyll-og-image docs](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov/jekyll-og-image?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

After that, I was finally able to add the `gem 'jekyll-og-image'` to my `Gemfile` and start generating the images as part of the `Jekyll build` command. But of course the first build failed! üí•

## Invalid markup in text

The build failed with the following stack trace:

```

After a small amount of frustration I figured out that half of the images were generated correctly. This made me think that the root cause had to be one particular blog post. Enabling `verbose` mode led me to a blog post that had an `&` symbol in the title. There is [a closed issue about this](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov/jekyll-og-image/issues/1), but it looks like it either regressed or wasn't fixed fully. My solution was simple: I replaced the ampersand with an `and` & moved on with my life!

## Second problem

I thought I was out of the woods at this point but after I pushed the changes to production the generated images were returning 404s. I verified that the images were being generated correctly in the GitHub action and then finally found out that they were not copied to the `_site` folder correctly. The `_site` includes all the static files that get uploaded to GitHub Pages so if files are missing they won't be accessible once the site is deployed. There is also an [existing issue about this as well](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov/jekyll-og-image/issues/14).

I noticed that rebuilding the project a second time correctly copies the generated images to the `_site` folder, so my solution was to run the build twice:

```yaml
      - name: Build with Jekyll
        # Outputs to the './_site' directory by default
        # Build twice because the first run doesn't copy generated images
        run: |
          bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"
          bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}" 
```

## Fin

And that was it. I now have og:images auto-generated by Jekyll! Hopefully, this will remove some of the friction and encourage me to blog more often! ü§û

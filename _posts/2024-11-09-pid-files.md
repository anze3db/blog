This week, my neighborhood had a few power outages. Bad news for the uptime of my self-hosted sites! üòÖ

After the power came back and my server started, Gunicorn services failed with the following error:

```
[2024-11-08 19:13:18 +0000] [1806] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
Error: Already running on PID 1401 (or pid file 'gunicorn.pid' is stale)
Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
Failed with result 'exit-code'.
```
Gunicorn usually deletes the PID file when it shuts down. But if the power goes out, the clean-up code does not have a chance to run. Because I stored the PID files in my `$HOME` directory, they didn't get cleaned up after reboot, causing the error above.

## Deleting PID files on reboot

I started looking for a solution to deleting the PID files on reboot and found posts about the `/var/run` folder. `var/run` is usually mounted as a [`tmpfs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs), so all its contents are deleted when your server shuts down.

I peeked into the folder and saw PID files for `nginx`, `sshd`, and others, so I thought I was on the right track!

But I ran into an issue when I tried to create my Gunicorn PID files inside `/var/run`. Only the `root` user has write permission, and I run all my Gunicorn processes as an unprivileged user. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A bit more Googling and I came across `/var/run/user/$UID`, but this [SO answer](https://superuser.com/a/1127720) convinced me that storing my PID files there is not a good idea.

## `/tmp`

I also considered storing the PID files inside `/tmp`, but from what I can tell, different distros have different policies on when the `/tmp` folder is cleared. It could be on reboot, but it could also be based on the file's age, and I didn't want my PID file to disappear after a few days!

## Taking a step back

I decided to take a step back and think about why I needed the PID files in the first place.

The sole reason was that my update script uses it to send the `-hup` signal to the Gunicorn process (it's how I do [No Downtime Deployments](https://blog.pecar.me/gunicorn-restart)). But reading the PID file isn't the only way to find Gunicorn's PID! 

Another way is to grep through `ps axf` command output. The solution I ended up using is this bash one-liner:

```bash
ps axf | grep 'gunicorn: master \[fedidevs\]' | awk '{print "kill -hup " $1}' | sh
```
The one-liner has a face only a mother could love, but it's better than dealing with services that do not start on boot because of a stale PID file, so this is my solution for now!

## Is there a better way?

Probably, but I was not able to figure it out. Please let me know if you know a better way to do this!

P.S.: LLMs are useless when answering questions about PID files. ChatGPT even thought I would want to persist PID files after a reboot:

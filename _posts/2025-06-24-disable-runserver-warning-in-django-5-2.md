[Django 5.2 added a new warning](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.2/#management-commands) that shows up when you start your development server with `python manage.py runserver`:

```
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production setting. Use a production WSGI or ASGI server instead.
For more information on production servers see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/deployment/
```

The warning is helpful for newcomers because Django's development server is neither secure nor performant enough to be exposed to the internet.

However, if you've already configured your production environment with a proper WSGI/ASGI server, seeing the warning every time your development server reloads becomes tedious. Luckily, there is a way to disable it with the [DJANGO_RUNSERVER_HIDE_WARNING](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/django-admin/#envvar-DJANGO_RUNSERVER_HIDE_WARNING) environment variable:


```python
‚ùØ DJANGO_RUNSERVER_HIDE_WARNING=true python manage.py runserver
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
June 24, 2025 - 07:39:40
Django version 5.2.3, using settings 'yourproject.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

If you are using [django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or any other tool that loads environment variables from a `.env` file, you can put the `DJANGO_RUNSERVER_HIDE_WARNING=true` line to it, and the warning will no longer show up. üéâ
